# Data Governance

## Overview
All arrest data is stored **exclusively** in the master Google Sheet identified by:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10mphJQkWlDoscDoY8CGFPt96yzoB7rAbDTRrR02orUY/edit

## Retention
- Raw scrape fixtures are kept for **30 days** in the `fixtures/` directory and are automatically pruned by the nightly CI job.
- Processed records remain in the sheet indefinitely; older rows can be archived manually to a separate "Archive" tab.

## Compliance
- No personally‑identifiable information (PII) beyond what is publicly available on county sheriff sites is stored.
- The sheet is shared **read‑only** with external partners; only the service‑account email has edit rights.
- Regular audits (quarterly) verify that the `bond_paid` column is refreshed and that no sensitive credentials are committed.

## Security
- Access to the sheet is controlled via a Google Service Account with **Editor** role limited to this spreadsheet.
- All API calls use the `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` environment variable; the raw key file is never committed.
- Logs are written to the `Logs` tab; they contain no secret data.
