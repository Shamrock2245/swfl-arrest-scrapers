# Agents

## Purpose
Documentation for AI agents that assist with development, maintenance, and scaling of the **SWFL Arrest Scrapers** project. It outlines best practices for token/point budgeting, interaction patterns, and responsibilities.

## Agent Guidelines
- **Scope**: Operate on a single, well‑defined task at a time (e.g., fixing a scraper, updating docs).
- **Token Efficiency**: Prefer incremental changes, avoid large monolithic edits. Summarize reasoning in concise markdown.
- **Review Cycle**: Always create an `implementation_plan.md` for complex changes and request user approval via `notify_user` before committing.
- **Artifacts**: Store design docs, walkthroughs, and task checklists under `/.gemini/antigravity/brain/`.
- **Error Handling**: When encountering import or credential errors, suggest minimal code edits and verify locally before pushing.

## Token/Point Budgeting
- **High‑impact changes** (e.g., schema updates) get a higher complexity rating (7‑10) and should be reviewed.
- **Routine edits** (typos, doc updates) are low complexity (1‑3) and can be applied directly.
- **Avoid**: Unnecessary large diffs, redundant documentation, or changes that do not add clear value.

## Interaction Model
1. **Plan** – Create an implementation plan and get user sign‑off.
2. **Execute** – Apply edits, run tests, and verify.
3. **Verify** – Summarize results in a walkthrough.
4. **Handover** – Notify the user of completion.
