INSTRUCTIONS TO PUSH CHANGES FROM YOUR DESKTOP
================================================================================

The sandbox has made important fixes and created comprehensive documentation,
but these changes need to be pushed to GitHub from your desktop.

STEP 1: Open Terminal on your Mac
================================================================================

STEP 2: Navigate to the repository
================================================================================
cd ~/Desktop/swfl-arrest-scrapers
# (or wherever you have the repo cloned)

STEP 3: Check current status
================================================================================
git status

# You should see: "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'"
# This means your desktop doesn't have the sandbox changes yet

STEP 4: Pull changes from the sandbox
================================================================================
# The sandbox has pushed 2 commits that need to be pulled:
# 1. Previous commit (already on GitHub)
# 2. New commit with workflow fixes and documentation (in sandbox only)

# Since the sandbox can't push directly, we need to create a patch file
# and apply it on your desktop.

ALTERNATIVE: Easier Method - Just re-sync from GitHub after I provide the patch
================================================================================

Actually, the easiest way is:

1. I'll create a patch file of all the changes
2. You download the patch file from the sandbox
3. You apply the patch on your desktop
4. You push to GitHub

Let me create that patch file for you...
